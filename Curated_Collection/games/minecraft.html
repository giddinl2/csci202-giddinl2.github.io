                <p>Minecraft is a game that needs little introduction, its popularity has risen and dropped over the years, but I’d be shocked to meet someone who hasn’t at least heard the name before. To summarize, Minecraft is a sandbox survival game with a blocky, pixelated, simplistic art style that was released in 2009, saw its full release in 2011, and still receives yearly updates to this day (Its 20th major update just came out June of this year). I believe the intention of the game was to give players a world where they could let their imagination run wild and do anything they put their mind to, and while no game can truly let its players do anything, I think Minecraft is the closest any game has come to achieving it.</p>
                <p>On the topic of design elements, there’s more to it than simply “Mine” and “Craft”, but I’ll cover those first since they are the namesake core mechanics. The first step towards making the player feel like they can do anything they want is allowing them to interact with and sculpt the world however they want to, and this is accomplished by allowing players to mine each individual block that makes up the world, and place them back down wherever they want. This allows the player to make structures like a house or a tower or an entire city if they want. The next step is allowing the player to take their gathered materials and use them to craft new blocks and items to build or accomplish whatever they want. This also allows the different mechanics of the game to mesh together, as the player can combine items from different aspects of the game into one new thing, like taking sticks from blocks of wood and string from spiders to make a bow or a fishing rod.</p>
