                <p>Slay the Spire is a roguelike deckbuilder that entered early access in 2017, and got its full release in 2019. To the best of my knowledge, it is one of the first games of it’s genre, and at the very least its the one that brought the genre into the spotlight with a huge boom of popularity following its release (Which did unfortunately lead to the creation of countless mediocre or outright bad “Spire clones” flooding the market, which has lead to the genre obtaining a bit of a bad reputation, but Slay the Spire is certainly one that did it right).</p>
	            <p>To briefly explain the gameplay; you pick a character, which determines both your starting deck (~10 cards, same every time), and what cards you’ll be able to find throughout the journey to the final boss(es). Cards range in effects from attacks (deal damage), to skills (defend yourself, apply a debuff, etc.), and powers (buffs that last for the remaining duration of your current fight). After every fight you’ll be given a selection of 3 random cards to add to your deck (from your character’s pool of unlocked cards). Individual fights play out in a turn-based system where you play cards until you run out of cards in your hand to play or out of energy to play them. There’s a handful of other encounters that break up fighting monsters; randomized events that can be helpful or harmful to the player (or often both), shops where you can spend gold to buy new cards from a limited selection, elite fights (minibosses, essentially), and rest points. The last points of interest are relics, which are passive items you can obtain throughout a run to assist you in various ways. The most consistent way to obtain them is by defeating elite enemies or buying them in shops.</p>
