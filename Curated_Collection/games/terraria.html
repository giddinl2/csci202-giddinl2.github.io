                <p>Terraria is a cross between a creative sandbox game and an RPG that was released in 2011, and has received regular updates ever since, with the "final" one coming sometime in 2024. I use quotes when I say "final" because the game is notorious for having six "final" updates at this point, supposedly because the developers just love the game too much to stop working on it.</p>
	            <p>Terraria has several of the same creative elements found in <a href="minecraft.html">Minecraft</a>, like the ability to mine and place the blocks that make up the world, and using blocks and items to craft new items, hence why some people jokingly call it "2D Minecraft", but having played both games, that's basically where the similarities end. Terraria has a much greater focus on combat, and especially boss fights, which are the primary means of progressing through the game. Several bosses in the game serve as milestones that unlock a plethora of new equipment for the player, but also advance the enemies in the world and sometimes even change the world itself to keep the challenge coming. This makes Terraria’s progression system one of my favorites among all the games I’ve played. Bosses unlocking new content is far from a novel idea, but the way the system is implemented into an otherwise creative-sandbox game is executed very well, and leaves me wishing I could replay the game without all my former knowledge so I could experience discovering everything all over again.</p>
