                <p>Risk of Rain 2 is a roguelike 3rd person shooter that entered early access in 2019, saw its full release in 2020, and got its first DLC in 2022. The original Risk of Rain was notably a 2D game, so Risk of Rain 2 departing into the 3rd dimension was a big step, but one that made all the difference. Both games share the same gameplay loop; the player is dropped into a stage full of enemies and chests to loot, and they must locate and charge the teleporter on the stage to advance to the next stage. The chests in the stage require gold to open, which is dropped by the enemies that spawn periodically, and beginning to change the teleporter will spawn a boss enemy for that stage that the player must defeat before progressing. The last notable element that the games share is the ever-advancing timer. As time passes and the game’s timer ticks up, enemies will gain more health and damage, so players can’t just leisurely loot every stage to its fullest, there’s always a sense of urgency and action. The addition of movement in a 3rd dimension made this game far more enjoyable than its predecessor, since it’s a lot harder to get surrounded by a swarm of enemies in 3D.</p>
	            <p>From my experience, it seems that roguelikes fall into one of two categories. Some of them are meticulously crafted and well balanced, allowing for players to make strong builds, but generally keeping things under control. Games in the other camp are generally still well balanced, but have synergies between items that are so strong that with a lucky enough run, eventually the player will spiral into ridiculous power levels and completely break the game, to the point where they can hardly tell what’s happening on their screen. I enjoy both of these varieties, but Risk of Rain 2 is firmly the latter. Most of the items in Risk of Rain 2 aren’t incredibly complex with paragraphs of text, they’re fairly simple one-or-two sentence effects, but the way they multiply and compound on each other leads to a very rewarding power curve.</p>
