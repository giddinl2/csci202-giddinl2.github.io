                <p>Factorio is a game about automation and logistics that entered early access in 2016, saw its full 1.0 release in 2020, and if all continues according to schedule, will see its first DLC in 2024 (which I am beyond excited for). I started playing the game myself during early access in 2018, and recently have had a resurgence of passion for the game.</p>
	            <p>The gameplay loop of Factorio can be described as the automated production of materials, and the automated consumption of those materials to make other materials. A standard example would be using drills to mine iron ore, which is placed onto a conveyor belt that carries it towards a furnace, where it is smelted into an iron plate, then placed onto another conveyor belt that carries it to an assembly machine that turns iron plates into gear wheels, which are a key component to automating the production of many items, like making more of the aforementioned drills, conveyor belts, and assembly machines to expand your factory. Even that long winded explanation left out a ton of details, and that’s pretty much the most basic example of automation the game has to offer. The game’s complexity deepens drastically as you progress through it, introducing new mechanics like trains to faster move bulk quantities of items long distances, or robot drones to automatically construct more factories based on blueprints made by the player. Any time the player would think to themselves “Man, I wish there was an easier way for me to do this task”, the game dangles that exact solution in front of the player, just out of reach, but obtainable if they can just progress a little further. It’s a very rewarding gameplay loop.</p>
